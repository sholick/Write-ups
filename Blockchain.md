# Blockchain

What is a blockchain? Two ways of explaining it:

<h3>Granny></h3>
A blockchain can be seen as a heavenly book that exist in an imaginary place. It is a very heavy dictionary, consisting of account balances of many people.<br/>
At any time, any person can open an empty account in this book, and people with balances can pay other people what they have. For example, according to the book, Alice has 10 dollars. Alice(and only Alice) can pay Bob half of her account balance, so each of them owns 5 dollars.<br/>
This is all easy and simple, but what's so special about this book? It is special because of the heavenly nature. The book can only be written according to the rules, and old records cannot be tampered with. It is always there, and not a single entity is allowed to make any changes to the old pages, or change the rules of how it can be written.<br/>
A blockchain thrive on this idea of being an always available, completely free to enter, incorruptible book of balances.
