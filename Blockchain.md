# Blockchain

What is a blockchain? My two ways of explaining it:

<h3>Granny</h3>
A blockchain can be seen as a heavenly book in an imaginary place. It is a very heavy dictionary, consisting of account balances of many people.<br/>
At any time, any people with balances can pay other people what they have. For example, according to the book, Alice has 10 dollars. Alice(and only Alice) can pay half of her account balance to Bob, who has an empty account. So, each of them owns 5 dollars at the end of the day.<br/>
This is all easy and simple, but what's so special about this book? It is special because of the heavenly nature. This book follows a set of rules, and it can only be written according to these rules. It is always there if you want to read it, and no one can make changes to the old pages, or change the rules of how it can be written.<br/>
A blockchain thrive on this idea of being an always available, completely free to enter, incorruptible book of balances.

<h3>Tech-savvy</h3>
A blockchain is run by a decentralized network of nodes, computer servers that accept transactions publicly or privately. Miner nodes gather the transactions they receive, verifying their cryptographic signature, and put them into "block" of transactions. Every now and then, a new block proposed by a miner gets accepted by the network through a consensus mechanism, and added to the "chain" of blocks before it, receiving a new balane as a reward. After that, a new cycle begins.<br/><br/>
Due to the competitive, intensive nature of producing a block, miners wish to earn rewards have to be a good actor, thereby following the rules of the network. In theory, as soon as half of the network(hash power) is acting in this manner, no one can produce blocks quicker than they do, hence bad actors will not win. The longest chain is the good chain.<br/><br/>
This simple, pure proof-of-work blockchain was what Bitcoin has set out to be. Of course, blockchains that come afterwards have different architectures, node types and consensus mechanisms, enabling faster blocks, less energy usage and other innovations.
